# Python ZIP Model (Multi-Class Classification, Image)

This repository provides a sample Python ZIP model (wrapping a Keras 3 model) for image multi-class classification.

You can directly upload the following files into Lens:

- Model File: `python_zip_model.zip`
- Dataset File: `small_imagewoof_val.zip`

To train the model from scratch, follow `keras_train_model.ipynb` (make sure to install `python_zip_model/requirements.txt` in your Python virtual environment).

For more information on model and dataset formats, refer to your Lens documentation.
