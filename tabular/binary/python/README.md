# Python ZIP Model (Binary Classification, Tabular)

This repository provides a sample Python ZIP model (wrapping a PyCaret 3 model) for tabular binary classification.

You can directly upload the following files into Lens:

- Model File: `python_zip_model.zip`
- Dataset File: `taxi_2020_test_converted_1000.zip` (label column is `with_tip`)

To train the model from scratch, follow `pycaret_train_model.ipynb` (make sure to install `python_zip_model/requirements.txt` in your Python virtual environment).

For more information on model and dataset formats, refer to your Lens documentation.
