# Python ZIP Model (Multi-Label Classification, Tabular)

This repository provides a sample Python ZIP model (wrapping a scikit-learn 1.5.2 model) for tabular multi-label classification.

You can directly upload the following files into Lens:

- Model File: `python_zip_model.zip`
- Dataset File: `test_label_idx.csv` and `classes.txt` (label column is `player_positions`)

To train the model from scratch, follow `sklearn_train_model.ipynb` (make sure to install `python_zip_model/requirements.txt` in your Python virtual environment).

For more information on model and dataset formats, refer to your Lens documentation.
